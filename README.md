## Phonology and ortography
### Consonants

|                 | Bilabial | Labiodental | Dental | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
| --------------: | :------: | :---------: | :----: | :------: | :-----: | :---: | :-----: |
| **Plosive**     | p        |             | t      |          | c       | k     | '       |
| **Nasal**       | m        |             | n      |          | ñ       | ŋ     |         |
| **Fricative**   |          | f    v      |        | s    z   |         |       |         |
| **Approximant** | w        |             | l      |          | j       | (w)   |         |

The plosives are voiceless, the nasals are voiced, the fricatives on the left are voiceless and on the right voiceless, and the approximants are voiced. The approximant l is lateral.

### Vowels

|           | Front | Back  |
| --------: | :---: | :---: |
| **Close** | i     | u*    |
| **Open**  |       | a     |

An asterisk marks rounded vowels. The vowels have two tones, low (a, i, u) and high (á, í, ú).

### Phonotactics
* The syllable structure is (P)(F/S)V(C), where P is a plosive, F is a fricative, S is a sonorant (nasal or approximant), V is a vowel, and C is a consonant.
* There are no consecutive nasals.
* The glottal plosive occurs only intervocalically (as an onset).

### Stress
The stress is on the last high-pitched syllable of the word, or on the penultimate syllable if there are only low-pitched syllables.

## Grammar

### Nouns

#### The prefix
Nouns have a one-to-two-letter prefix, where the first letter (or its absence) marks number and the second letter marks definiteness/negativity and specificity.

| Number      | Affix |
| ----------: | :---: |
| Singular    | -     |
| Paucal      | m-    |
| Plural      | n-    |
| Superplural | ñ-    |
| Collective  | ŋ-    |

The collective number refers to all entities of a category.

|               | Nonspecific | Specific |
| ------------: | :---------: | :------: |
|**Definite**   | -a-         | -á-      |
|**Indefinite** | -i-         | -í-      |
|**Negative**   | -u-         | -ú-      |

Definiteness and specificity work like in [Shiofaioth](https://github.com/SurrealPartisan/shiofaioth/blob/main/README.md). I still have to figure out how they interact with the collective number. I also have to figure out how the negative interacts with specificity and number.

Proper nouns take the prefix too (most often á-, I guess). It is not capitalized, but the first letter of the root is. For example the language itself is most often referred to as áMañíŋan.
